# ðŸ¦„ Alfred Unicorn pHAT

Comes preloaded with standard colours for "busy", "away", and "active" status'.

Biggest potential of this workflow is the External Webhook. Using applescript you can trigger a lightchange from any workflow, cronjob, ect:

```osascript
tell application id "com.runningwithcrayons.Alfred" to run trigger "aup" in workflow "com.davidsword.alfredunicornphat" with argument "red"
```
